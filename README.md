# NLP-sentiment-analysis-using-distilBERT-
Designing my own architecture for distilBERT  with LSTM layer and fine tuned on reddit dataset.
### I have taken the data from “https://files.pushshift.io/” website a couple of months ago. As push-shift is under violation, so they turned off Pushshift’s access to Reddit’s Data API from the previous month. Before it was open to access and then I downloaded my dataset.
